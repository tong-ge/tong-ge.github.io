    BAD LAND is where I born,
    so a BAD LIFE is the default.
    It's stupid, but that's the law. 
    I'm at my wit's end. 
    </p>
    <p>
    To resist, I 
    escape from the enemy. 
    I crawl like a snake and fight well. 
    But in the end,the move which TURN THE TABLE
    Why I simply can't keep it!

    <p>
    Dark, lawless society vs. Bright, future world
    I'll go to the latter
    Are you okay? Shut up.
    </p>
    <p>
    A life that has been pushed to the limit 
    which seems to be crazier than I imagined. 
    The useless function of the life 
    is what I'd like to @Override a little here,
    But the reality is that it doesn't seem to go that well.
    The words I spit out are my beliefs,
    and I'm discrete again.

    Well, everything in this world can be explained by the draw of the gacha,
    right? I can just use the energy I need to turn it around and try something else. 
    Well, this hell can be influenced by money, 
    so it can be influenced to any extent, 
    right? There's no way you can escape
